## About the ‘Data_Summary’ data table

The ‘Data_Summary' table was created by using the following data set:

Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset Version 1.0
Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz, Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto. Smartlab - Non Linear Complex Systems Laboratory DITEN - Universit? degli Studi di Genova. Via Opera Pia 11A, I-16145, Genoa, Italy. activityrecognition@smartlab.ws www.smartlab.ws

The Human Activity Recognition database is built from the recordings of 30 subjects performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors. The data was collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. 

More informations about the original data set can be found here.

Here are the data for the project:

The purpose of this script is to collect and clean the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository in R. The resulting ‘Data_Summary' table is a selection of the original dataset that only contains measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement and creates a new dataset with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
