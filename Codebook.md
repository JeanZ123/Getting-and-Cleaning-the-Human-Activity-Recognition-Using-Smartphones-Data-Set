## Description of the 'data_summary' data table

### About the 'data_summary' data table

The 'data_summary' table was created by using the following data set:

> Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset Version 1.0
> Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz, Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto. Smartlab - Non Linear Complex Systems Laboratory DITEN - > UniversitÃ  degli Studi di Genova. Via Opera Pia 11A, I-16145, Genoa, Italy. activityrecognition@smartlab.ws www.smartlab.ws

In the official description of the dataset general information on the dataset is given:

> The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person 
> performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone 
> (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration > and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data
> manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for 
> generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

> The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-
> width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has 
> gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and 
> gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff 
> frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency > domain.

The purpose of the script 'run_Analysis.R' is to collect and clean the Human Activity Recognition Data Set. The resulting 'Data_Summary' table is a selection of the original dataset that 1.) only contains measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement and 2.) creates a new dataset with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Producing the 'data_summary' table

In order to produce the 'tidy_data_summary' table, the script 'run_analysis.R' was created and used. It performs the following tasks:

**Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set with target variables**

1. Binds these files,

- UCI HAR Dataset/train/subject_train.txt
- UCI HAR Dataset/train/X_train.txt
- UCI HAR Dataset/train/y_train.txt.

from the train set by columns to a table that contains, the human subject, the activity performed and the values of the features.

2. Binds these files,

- UCI HAR Dataset/test/subject_test.txt
- UCI HAR Dataset/test/X_test.txt
- UCI HAR Dataset/test/y_test.txt.

from the test set by columns to a table that contains, the human subject, the activity performed and the values of the features.

3. Binds the data frames created for test and train set into one large dataset by rows.

**Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement**

1. Finds the target features, which are the features with measurements about mean and standard deviation, and extracts them as well as those that indicate the 'subject' and 'activity' and creates a new data table only with the target variables.

**Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set**

1. Replace the variable about activity, that contains integers from 1 to 6, with a factor based on levels and labels contained in the 'activity_labels' data file.

**Appropriately labels the data set with target variables with descriptive names**

1. Extracts the target variable names from 'features.txt'
2. Corrects a typo that exists in some feature names, that is to replace 'BodyBody' that appears in the names of some features with just 'Body'.
3. Creates a new tidy dataset with the appropriate labels for the variable names.

**From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject**

1. Group the tidy data table created in step 4, by 'subject' and 'activity'.

2. Summarize each variable to find the average for the grouped values.

3. Ungroup the data table.

4. Add descriptive names to the variables of the new tidy data table, by adding the prefix 'Avrg-' in the names of the target feature averages.

5. Write the data in a text file in the present working directory.
